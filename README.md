This is our code for the assignment 5 of [15-816 Linear Logic](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~fp/courses/15816-s12/).

We implemented in [Celf](http://clf.github.com/celf/) the operational semantics of Paul Blain Levy's
call-by-push-value language extended with lazy substitution,
mutable storable and limited forms of concurrency.
For more information about the core language,
see [Call-By-Push-Value FAQ](http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~pbl/cbpv.html).
